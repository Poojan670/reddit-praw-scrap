1777dpc,A 95 year old man and his 94 year old wife see a lawyer about a divorce.,"The lawyer asks them when they got married.

""I was 19"" says the man.

""That means you've been married for 75 years at least"" the lawyer points out

""Yes.  And all of it misery"" says the woman.

""Really?  When did you start to regret the marriage?""

""Almost immediately, "" says the man.  ""I hated her after about two years, and every year it gets worse.  Everything about her is obnoxious and irritating.""

""Oh lord, "" says the woman, ""I lasted three years but after that tolerating him in any way has been a huge problem.  He has awful habits and treats me like trash.""

The lawyer thinks for a moment.

""Well I can help you to get divorced, but why did you wait so long to apply for one if you've hated each other the whole time?""

She says:  ""We were waiting for the children to die"""
1779sv3,A poor farmer has two sons; a smart one and a dumb one.,"One day he goes to his smart son and he tell him “Bring this duck to the market and sell it for 5 dollars. If you sell for any extra go ahead and take that to the whorehouse on your way back home.”

So the son goes to the market with the duck, manages to sell it for 7 dollars and promptly goes to the whorehouse and spends the extra 2 dollars he had earned and gets home by the end of the day.

About a month later the farmer needs a few extra bucks so he decides to use the same plan with his sons. For some reason this time he can’t find his smart son so he goes to the dumb son and says again “take this duck to the market and sell it for 5 dollars. Any extra you earn you can go spend at the whorehouse on the way home.”

The dumb son leaves carrying the duck but after getting a couple miles out he gets horny and forgets what he was sent to do so he turns the truck straight to the whorehouse. Upon arrival the lady running the place asks him how he expects to pay and he says “well I got this duck.” The lady thinks it over and decides there’s no harm in getting paid a duck for a couple minutes. So she takes him into the next room and they have wild amazing sex. After they finish she says to him “Wow that was fantastic. Can we please do this again? I’ll even let you keep the duck.” And he happily agrees.

Now tired he goes to drive back home. On the drive the duck gets spooked and flies out the window, directly into the path of a semi. The semi driver immediately pulls over and so does the son. The driver says “Oh my god I’m so sorry I killed your duck, it all happened in a flash. Please take 15 dollars for your troubles.” And the son happily agrees and goes on his way.

Once he arrives home his father asks him how much money he got. The son proudly empties his pocket and shows his father the 15 big ones. The farmer is stunned and asks him exactly what happened that day. The son says “Well, I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, and 15 bucks for a fucked up duck!”"
177bp8z,a man buys a parrot,"A man buys a parrot. The bird is beautiful, but swears in the most foul manner all day long.

The man tries everything to silence the parrot: he covers the cage, he turns on loud music, he threatens to hit the parrot... but it's all of no use.

After a few days of incessant ranting, he becomes so unnerved that he grabs the parrot and puts it in the freezer. The parrot is rioting around at first, but then suddenly everything in the freezer becomes dead quiet.

The man feels guilty and is afraid that the parrot may have died of fear. So he opens the chest again. The parrot climbs out, climbs up the man's arm, sits on the shoulder and says, ""I would like to apologize profusely for my unbecoming behavior. I assure you that this will never happen again.""

The man is completely flabbergasted, but before he can say anything himself, the parrot clears his throat and says: ""If you allow me to ask... what did the chicken do?"""

Mama's still cooking spaghetti and says, ""Oh, you such a lucky a girl, that means that he's a strong, virile man. You have lots of bambinos! Now go back upstairs.""
She goes back up and Luigi is sitting on the bed with his shoes and socks off, and he's missing all the toes on his left foot. She runs back down and says, ""Mama, Mama he's a got a foot and a half!""

173ye4w,The 2023 r/anime Awards Announcement and Jury Application,"# [LINK TO THE JUROR APPLICATION](https://animeawards.moe/apps)

# APPLICATIONS CLOSE OCTOBER 22nd 23:59 PDT!

# [Countdown](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20231022T235959&p0=137&msg=%2Fr%2Fanime+Awards+Application+Deadline&font=cursive)

Welcome back to the 8th annual /r/anime Awards! It's once again time to watch a bunch of seasonals and argue about which one was best.

# Changes in 2023

* Short Series has been merged with Anime of the Year.

* Cast now has 10 nominations.

* The Jury Writing Project will now source questions from the Public in a thread posted on a later date.


If you want to know more about our reasoning for these changes and/or specifically discuss them, refer to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/173ye4w/the_2023_ranime_awards_announcement_and_jury/k45thio/) where we've detailed each point more thoroughly.

Also, in case you missed it, here is how the Awards looked last year: [Announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/y0fiu7/the_2022_ranime_awards_announcement_and_jury) | [Results post](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11c1yg8/the_results_of_the_2022_ranime_awards) | [Website](https://animeawards.moe/results/all) | [Livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dAmr9nV2_I)

# [The Awards Process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5WSBY-RDrE)

The base format of the Awards still remains: The Awards are split into two groups, the Public and the Jury, who will each nominate anime and separately rank them.

The Public is everyone on /r/anime. You will have a comfortable amount of time to vote to nominate a number of shows per category on our snazzy website. The series/characters with the most votes will go on to become your official nominees. These nominees will be combined with the Jury nominees and then together they will form the final list from which both groups will vote and rank on. **Public nominations start January 1st**.

The Jury is a group of /r/anime users who have passed the Juror Application. Applicants are evaluated based on their ability to analyze anime and communicate their thoughts. They will select their nominees after thorough discussion, having familiarized themselves with the anime in their respective categories. These nominees will be combined with the Public nominees after which the Jury will watch all the nominations to completion and rank them to pick a winner.

While 2023 is the 8th year of the awards, we'll be coming up on our **6th** year of running a live stream of the results on Twitch, complete with commentary, clip reels, and guest appearances!

Follow these links for [**2018**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/378182599), [**2019**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/556372396), [**2020**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/922464201), [**2021**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wInZ-jcPHw), and [**2022**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dAmr9nV2_I)'s broadcasts.

# The Juror Application


Juror applications are now officially open until **October 22nd 23:59 PDT (UTC-7)**. Jury members will then be selected and invited to the Awards by **November 3rd**.

We are opening applications early in order to give the jurors time to watch as many shows as possible before nominations begin. This also means that being a juror may be time-consuming. Your responsibility is from November to February, and you’re expected to familiarize yourself with most of the shows in your category. That said, there are rarely time-related issues if you only apply for one or two categories and if you have already watched a lot of shows.

If you still feel the time commitment is too much, why not sign up as an open juror? This allows you to hang out with other passionate anime fans and experience the Awards as a juror without needing to participate in the usual required discussion a category juror would need to.

If you want to know more about the specifics of being a juror, you can read the [**Jury Guide**](https://animeawards.moe/juryguide).

### If being a juror sounds like something for you, please click [this link](https://animeawards.moe/apps) (or the one up top/below) and fill out the application. 

###We always need more people, so thank you so much for applying!

&#x200B;

Most of you guys said ""NO!!!""

Let me tell you, you are horrible people!

My wife finished it a few minutes ago.

She enjoyed it and laughed when I told her I had a poll going in the internet about spoiling her. She finds you guys hilarious. Also she said the foreshadowing was to strong and the only guessing was who would off the mc.

I learned a valuable lesson today.

I will never betray my wife! Ever!"
