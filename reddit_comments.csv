1777dpc,k4rv26n,"95 year old woman in a small town calls the funeral home.

1777dpc,k4sebx3,"A 95-year-old woman goes before a judge for throwing her husband out a window.

The judge says, “You’ve been married for over 70 years. Why in the world would you throw your husband out the window?“

The woman responds, “He came home and said that he had had an affair. I figured if he could have an affair at his age, he could fly!“",0

1777dpc,k4s2aoh,I live with mine (I'm 60) so they don't have to go to assisted living.  I take care of everything including their finances (got them out of a $16000 hole arguing with a credit card company).

1777dpc,k4riz0g,"Why? It isn't even a good punchline. Like, what is this a play on? Where is the humor supposedly found? It's just edgy and shocking for the sake of it, but it makes no sense as a joke.",1
1777dpc,k4rvvdw,It's a play on waiting for the kids to leave home.,1
1777dpc,k4s4lt6,I guess they just got tired of waiting for you to die…you ungrateful little shit!,1
1777dpc,k4s9xra,"Yeah my parents divorced after 52 years of marriage. All 4 kids were like “I can’t believe it lasted that long!”  (Proud of you, mom)",1
1777dpc,k4sm6kx,Did you ever talk to either of them and did they ever explain their feelings or anything about the late stage divorce,1
1777dpc,k4sjy4e,"It's a poor version of the joke and the success of it lies in the telling/delivery. 

The backstory about their misery doesn't add to the joke.

A 90 year old couple goes to a lawyer and says they'd like a divorce. He asks them how long they've been married, '70 years' they reply. 'That's a long time to be married, why do you want to get divorced all of a sudden?' 'Well, we talked it over and we decided it would be best if we waited until the children died.'

This version leaves out the irrelevant details about their hatred. It focuses on their over concern for their kids' emotional health to the point of absurdity.",1
1777dpc,k4rv7rx,"I’ve heard it before. It’s a joke with seniority, if you will.",1
1777dpc,k4sb56c,"The punchline just isn't very clever. It might work as a mix of deadpan and dark humor when properly told in person, but it's pretty hit-and-miss in written form.",1
1777dpc,k4rxq6d,I think this joke would go down well in retirement homes.,1
1777dpc,k4s2hwu,it's the best humor.. that and perverted humor,1

1777dpc,k4s3q4t,How is “waiting for the children to leave the house” not funnier?  It’s a better commentary on our current society.,1
1777dpc,k4ryaw6,"Don't listen to the naysayers. Humor is subjective. Not everyone will find everything to be funny.

I thought it was funny. I saw what you did there and I appreciate it, even if many others do not.

BTW, it's also a commentary on how committed to their kids they were.",1
1777dpc,k4rvjdn,"The problem is that while you did succeed in being surprising, the surprise wasn't particularly funny. It just felt kinda random, and while some people might find that funny I don't think most do.",1
1777dpc,k4slj1h,If people don’t think your joke is funny they can just move on. Not everyone thinks everyone else’s jokes are funny. Some of my jokes make some people laugh and others just roll their eyes. I mostly remember the laughter.,1
1777dpc,k4s3isk,"I didn't invent it. I think it was a Buddy Hackett joke that he told on the Tonight Show, but I won't swear to it.  Anyway, it's one of my favorite jokes.",1

He still drives his Tesla 500 km for any servicing he can't do on his own. Mom video calls me a few times a week. They are rock stars among their contemporaries.,2
1777dpc,k4rkzq4,Cause people stay together for the kids.........and may divorce after the kids have grown... not wait till they die.  Sheesh,2
1777dpc,k4sp4vm,I talked to my mom. My stepdad became an alcoholic and just started being mean toward my mom. She put up with it for years and finally got the courage to leave .,2
1777dpc,k4tea1y,"I dunno, I quite like this version. I feel it it underscores how bitter and mean they are and that really sells the 'waiting for the children to die' line.",2

Guy goes duck hunting for the first time.  He shoots a duck but it falls in the farmer’s yard.

Guy goes to get the duck and the farmer  says “It’s in my yard, that makes it my duck.”

Hunter says “But I shot it.  That makes it my duck.”

Framer says “Fine.  We’ll settle this country style.”

Hunter says “What’s country style.”

“Well we take turns kicking each other in the nuts.  Last man standing gets the duck.”

The hunter really wants the duck, it’s his first one ever so he agrees.

Farmer says “We’re on my land, so I get to go first.”

Farmer winds up and kicks the hunter as hard as he can, right in the nuts.  Guy rolls around on the ground in agony for a few minutes but finally gets back on his feet.

He’s ready to get even now.  Says “Alright, it’s my turn.”

Farmer says, “That’s okay.  You can have the duck.”",2

1777dpc,k4rxfrm,"But, the expected result is children outliving their parents. So, what is the implication of the parents' wait? That is where the joke is supposed to be. Like I said, this is just subverting expectations for the sake of a shock. Doesn't land as a joke. I am sure there is a joke to be told with the premise, but rhe kids dying ain't it.",3

1777dpc,k4sij6x,Sand ...,4
1777dpc,k4s4l3u,"I think the final line comes off as just mean more than it intends.

It wants to subvert the expectation of more story/joke but it kinda implies they knew or wanted their kids to die before them.

Maybe the final line might have been something like, 

She says, ""we were staying together for the kids, but you know...Covid.""

There is still a punchline about dead kids, but the death is a shocking suprise and is less ""mean""?",4
1777dpc,k4sbtzo,"And doing that... gets the lawyer disbarred??

But. why. that sounds so reasonable.",4
1777dpc,k4sgy7p,"Still the same thing though, so why sugarcoat it when you can just say whatever you actually mean? 

Your response is making sense though, as to why so many tell half-truths instead of just speaking up. 

Tell the whole truth instead, even if someone think you’re mean for it.",5

I called up the guy and found him on instagram for good measure and had him send me the insurance so that I could deal with them. His grandma even called me to make sure her young grandson was ""doing the right thing"" and I let her know it was all good.

All of the biggies operate mostly on the level.  The worst of the worst of the big companies do is make you wait a fucking long time to resolve it.

LPT: If you are ever in a car accident and the insurance company is dragging it's feet, 1) get a personal injury attorney involved or 2) start forwarding them your hospital bills.  

Usually a ""mention"" of doctors or attorneys lights the fire, but sometimes you need to follow through.

The day after I get served with the lawsuit (and was in a massive state of panic) I got a call from my old insurance company.  They said no, this was actually absolutely bullshit, and they were going to fight it.  And that was IT - I literally did nothing else.

Preferably look for someone who represents plaintiffs rather than defendants.  Defense firms represent the insurance company.

You wouldn't get the whole amount back, as you did have the car covered for accidents for the time you owned it, and the insurere was covering that risk.  You should get back the pro-rata amount now that you don't own the car though.

A few months ago, a deer ran in front of me and I swerved and ended up in a huge ditch. For some reason all my airbags deployed. My deductible is $1k and it was a $20k job to get it fixed, my insurance paid $19k

There’s some point where your car isn’t worth costing that much money, in that case insurance pays for the value of your car

What’s stupid about it is that it wasn’t *really* my fault, I slammed on the breaks and swerved into the ditch. Not sure if it would’ve been cheaper to just hit the deer, but no external damage happened, the side airbags deployed. So with out ever having an accident and with no one to blame it on, it made my cost of insurance go up. Even tho I’ve definitely paid them over $20k during my years of driving with no accidents

Premiums vary based on how much expected loss is eliminated for the insurance company by you having a deductible. So a higher deductible means a lower premium.

Deductibles also incentivize insureds to mitigate their exposure to risk (e.g. drive more safely), since they have skin in the game. You also get to choose your deductible based on how much you can cover yourself or want to pay for premiums.

Every claim you make just bumps you back one year. So if you had a 7 year record and make a claim, you use one of your free claims and are at the 6 year line. After no more claims for a year you're back at 7.

If you were just at the 75% discount rate and make a claim, you go down to 70% discount (or 65% or whatever). Then the next year you're back to 75%.

So it makes sense to only insure for big ticket things that you would not want to risk being on the hook for, but for minor things like oil changes or routine maintenance, or a small ding on your car door you might want to just cover it yourself.

I don't want to spend a week of nights playing a game before it becomes enjoyable.  Just like how a show should not start slow.  If I have to watch half of a season before it pops off then I'm okay not watching any of it.

Same with games.  If I need to put 10 hours into it before it becomes good I'd rather just miss the remaining 20 hours I might get out of it.

Having the launcher open counted as time played, and it took hours for some people to download the 100 GB of content, and many would have to restart the download due to issues at launch.

However, if they were to suddenly flip it around, monetize it, somehow add a battlepass, etc., it'd wildly shape my opinion of it and make me disappointed enough to leave a bad/1-star review.  


It happens, and unfortunately happens enough to where developers get greedy, or fail to stay in touch with their audience, and it nukes a good game from being great and instead to abysmal.

Random things that stood out to me, prices USD:

* School Live for $5 is impulse purchase territory, if I didn't already have it.
* $34 for Demon Girl Next Door s2 isn't cheap but it's the lowest I've seen it since it came out, and the disc release is only a few months old.
* Big O for $24.
* Grimoire of Zero was a fairly middling show but it's $7 which is kind-of another ""fuck it, why not?"" buy, again if I didn't already have it. I got the premium edition for that from Sentai when it was marked down stupid low in a previous sale, it was worth what I paid for it.
* Flying Witch for $14.
* Dusk Maiden of Amnesia also $14.
* RahXephon for $18.
* There's also some Made in Abyss stuff in there but since I don't follow the series too closely I don't know the names for the different seasons and packs so I'm a little unsure as to what is what, and if any of it's a good deal. Looks like s1 is $14 but then after that I get lost on the continuity.

I ended up getting Big O since I've been meaning to get it for years and never got around to it; its first run on Adult Swim was one of my formative anime experiences. Got Demon Girl s2 because I've been holding off on watching it until I got the disc (since I already have and enjoyed s1) and the price isn't too bad for a ""close-to-new"" release. And I caved and got RahXephon on BD to replace my ADV DVDs since that's among my favorite BONES originals.",0

176v84r,k4srodl,"Next batch of seasonals done for now. 

- Butareba is fucking awful, not only horribly creepy but just outright bad as a fetish show. Even Yoshitsugu Matsuoka can't save this atrocious script, and a show that fundamentally doesn't understand it's own appeal. 

- My New Boss is Goofy is really boring. It's one of those shows that would work infinitely better as a short, it has one single joke it never deviates from and is only funny once or twice. It's already separated into vignettes and they get old in the full-length format, but I still think it would be bad otherwise given that the material just isn't interesting in the first place. ""Aww, my new boss is cute and doesn't traumatize me"" is not a good punchline. 

- Tearmoon Empire is a lot of fun, and is somehow the second show this year centered around finding a clever way to have a villainess isekai without the isekai part. Simple so far but has promise and is very charming, will definitely see where it goes. 

- 16bit Sensation is great, tons of passion for it's subject matter and Konoha acts like a nerd in the same way that I do, she's great. Seems like a good look at the rose tinted glasses we view these industries and their golden ages through, and it has some very fun visual details. I'm just slightly disappointed that they had a taiyaki truck appear suddenly but it didn't turn into a Kanon reference. 

- Undead Unluck is absolutely fucking rad. Hilarious and genuinely cool in it's rule-of-cool, I can't believe I've never thought of ""rocket boots made of blood spurting out of a guys legs"" before. Yuki Yase and the Fire Force team knocked it out with the style, and the delivery makes every bit of humor land. Izumo and Andy are already a great duo. I'm never sure what to think of the new Shounen Jump property but I'm a big fan of this one, and I really hope it doesn't go the way of Yase's previous battle shounen and lose all the charm.",0

I like most of the characters and think the concept is pretty cool. It's also cool that they show early on how it would lead to corruption and exploitation of the weaker players. It does feel a little conflicted about it being a video game world but also not being a video game world. So some stuff is video game-y, some isn't. I'm sure that's by design but so far that feels a bit weird to me at times.

176v84r,k4paoes,"Didn't know if I wanted to start a whole thread or not, but you know, this may be the perfect place for it:

After putting ep 1 of each show side by side, I might like Hellsing (2001) more than Hellsing Ultimate. Or at least each one's first episode.

Which is a shame, because Hellsing Ultimate has kind of become ""the quintessential Hellsing Experience""\*, but 2001 I think has the better direction and pacing. The obvious way where 2001 Hellsing is better than Ultimate is how it actually spends time developing and fleshing out characters, adding a bunch of extra scenes in the adaptation to show Ceres adapting to joining the Hellsing adaptation and having a way more consistent and serious tone. Meanwhile Ultimate is speed running the opening chapters and we're basically blazing past Cere's onboarding.

But I also think the direction in '01 is better as well. A good example is when Alcuard is gunning down the first priest baddie in Ep 1 of either show. In '01 the power of his high calibur guns is punctuated as a single, slow motion explosion of raw power, and in Ultimate he's rapid firing them like a machine gun. Yeah, in the latter it's ""cooler"" and technically better animated, but it actually makes those guns feel weaker and the action disconnected from what's actually happening. Dunno if that makes sense, but the overall feel is that ""this looks cool"" without really grounding anything in the world. Hellsing '01, despite its TV budget compared to the OVA/Movie budget of Ultimate, I think builds better atmosphere and dread. Also, [its OP slaps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMNJwUUHMxc).

That being said, I think Ultimate is honestly leaning far into the camp and ridiculous aspects (and the source material honestly is kind of ridiculous) I think its also fair to say that it's not necessarily worse, but just completely different. '01 makes gestures towards taking itself seriously, but Ultimate seems to have no interest in that \*at all\*. Makes sense because '01 Hellsing forked from the original source material, and with the tone it was setting I don't think Nazi Vampires flying in on blimps was really going to match its more grounded tone.

I will probably go back to Ultimate and see if it gets better (I get the sense the first few episodes are ""playing catch up"" and assumes you've either read the manga or seen the first show) but I think before that I am going to give the original '01 adaptation some love, because it seems like its worth a revisit.

That's all, but would like to see what other people think of the both side by side.

That being said, I didn't really click with a lot of shows this season (unlike in spring and the current lineup) so I feel like I may have missed out on a couple interesting shows.

The list might also increase by one because I haven't finished [Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End](https://anilist.co/anime/154587/Sousou-no-Frieren/) first episode due to my wife becoming massively bored during the watch and forcing a skip around the 7th minute (the shooting star shower scene). I wasn't especially convinced either, I don't think I'll continue it, but I need to finish the episode before forming an opinion.

Considering that last season I watched like 3 shows in total, and when a season is good to me I have like 6 seasonals at most, having _15_ of them is a crazy number for me. I'm absolutely satisfied and I'm glad I went trough each one of them without judging them by the synopsis/genres/cover. I would have never given a chance to shows like Tearmoon, I'm in love with the villainess, 16 bit sensation or Undead Unluck otherwise.

The reason he likes Maki is because she defeats a dinosaur (Which is fair, I guess)).

But the the reason why he doesn't like JJK is because and I quote, ""It bores the shit outta me as I'm watching discount team 7 in highschool.

176v84r,k4quf1v,"The ""modern isekai"" influx stems from Narou, a webnovel platform. The short version is that it was just somewhere to post amateur fiction. A lot of it was fan-fiction, but eventually that got banned in favour of original works. A common fan-fic series was *The Familiar of Zero*. Since that's an isekai, you can basically take your own character and easily slap them into the world since that already exists. With fan-fic banned, the easy alternative is just write the same thing, but with your own world.

Eventually a few of the stories on Narou started getting picked up for distribution as light novels, and then you have an easy pipeline to anime. *Log Horizon* was the first from the site to wind up as an anime, debuting in 2013. There's a lot of different series you can try to pin as establishing tropes or whatever, but realistically it's a big wave of series all feeding off each other and doing a little yoink-and-twist action. Isekai was popular on Narou, so there's incentive to make more of it, and gradually those fans stick around because they're getting what they want. Publishers see something popular they can sell as light novels, and boom the ecosystem basically builds up a couple specific styles of stories.",1

176v84r,k4qt0ig,"Sword Art Online started it, and there were also the Mushoku Tensei novels which were really influential and codified some of the tropes associated with modern isekai. the Web Novel scene heavily influenced how it developed, and the first few major adaptations made a big splash and inspired producers to go obsessively hunting for the next big thing, or at least something that could turn a quick profit. I think that the secret to the longevity of a boom like this is starting with a few quality tentpoles, and then the garbage pours in. In this case I feel like Konosuba, Overlord, and Re:Zero were that in terms of anime. Though I'm not entirely sure when generic power fantasy became more common than more novel concepts or takes on the basic story. I guess it was just inevitable that it'd get flattened out into the most boring, least common denominator version of itself? There's also sort of the 'meta' in terms of one-upmanship in wacky premises, with different professions, non-traditional aspirations, and being reincarnated as something other than human being the primary ways of differentiation. 

At this point isekai has carved such a niche that it doesn't have to remotely try anymore. You saw people insisting that one Isekai Cheat Skill show was good entertainment despite it being aggressively fatphobic, shallow, unpleasant trash with storytelling that basically amounted to a series of 'and everyone clapped'. Like, the average trash web novel writer is still capable of writing actual characters and a semi-coherent, if not good story, but we're at the point now where a property so fundamentally broken in terms of characters, story, themes, and direction is slurped up by people. even more than that, people had no excuse when Kamikatsu was airing that season (at least that did find an audience).

Sk8 the infinity, a nice and short sports anime about skateboarding. The characters are very entertaining and it makes skateboarding look a lot funner than real life. 

Inuyasha, a perfect mix between shonen and romance. It's about a girl who was reincarnated 500 years in the future, she travels back in time to when her first incarnation was alive and meets Inuyasha, a half demon who was her first incarnations true love.

176v84r,k4s9l2b,"I guess depends on why you didn't like CSM. CSM is on par with AOT in terms of being serious (CSM is actually more fatalistic with it's characters than early AOT). It does actually feel quite put together (at least Part 1 haven't gotten into 2 yet) especially in regards to the overall themes Fuji is going for. That said it's still basically a cheap B movie horror action story (like Evil Dead or something). That is what it is going for. 

**Serious shows that I think have a lot bishonen esque characters that appeal to a shojo fanbase**

- Moriarty the Patriot - Sherlock if written like Death Note with bishonen male characters.

- The Case Study of Vantias - Like the above shonen manga with attractive bishonen male leads. Does have some chibi humour that might detract from the ""seriousness"" but it's still a pretty good action low fantasy story about fighting vampires that can be serious. Vanitas is one of the better bishe designs I have seen in the medium personally. 

- Mobile Suit Gundam Iron Blood Orphans - Largely serious tone with a big male cast. You don't need any past experience with Gundam to enjoy it  as it's a standalone AU story

- Legend of the Galactic Heroes - Watch the first two prequel films My Conquest is A Sea of Stars and Overture to a New War and skip the first two episodes of the main series after seeing the films. Overture covers the first two episodes better. Extra content you can watch after the fact is the prequel Gaiden and the remake **if you are okay with something older Reinhard is up there as bishonen excellence. Remake while I think is inferior (due to smaller nit pick reasons) does have more modern designs granted you will be waiting for them to adapt it all**

- Banana Fish - If you haven't this. I would check it out. It's actually shojo but a pretty good serious action crime thriller with bishonen men. 

**Other shows I would recomend that are quite serious in tone but may not meet the bishonen requirement**

- Monster - the best crime drama in the medium in my opinion. Way more grounded than Death Note and slower but really good at especially writing side characters. If you end up liking it I would check out the upcoming Pluto which is also by Urasawa.

- Parasyte the Maxim - Has a lot of the body horror elements you might be interested in from CSM. Shinichi as an MC feels kinda like body horror Peter Parker  aka wimpy nerd becomes action hero after getting powers. 

- Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju - Josei manga and a very good serious drama. 

- Ghost in the Shell Films and Stand Alone Complex - Sci Fi Classic for a reason. 

- Vinland Saga - Very good historical drama. Canute is a bishonen at the beginning lol but kinda loses that as he gets older. 

- Cyberpunk Edgerunners - Early David I guess could qualify but besides that generally good take on the dark action cyberpunk setting and a good adaption of the TTRPG and game. Watch the dub more immersive.

- March Comes in Like a Lion - Very good drama tackles the topic of depression quite well and many other serious life topics. Mangaka is a former Josei mangaka (Honey and Clover which is good too) though March is seinen. 

- Moribito - Guardian of the Spirit - Very good low fantasy action series. Balsa is one of the cooler action female leads in the medium.

It's not a surprise to me that it's omnipresent in places where you wouldn't expect it.

As an incidental point, another reason I've stuck with anime is that it's one of the few outlets of ""low conflict"" series.

> Giving the pig isekai another episode as it wasn't clear where it's going

I always find these sorts of shows tricky, because people often write them off very quickly and they're often right to do so, especially in terms of the flavor being wrong for their tastes even if the content turns out to be notably different from what they initially judged a show for.

This is often the case even when the show is dropping unambiguous hints that something else is going on, like *Love Flops* did. If people don't like the surface content, they're unlikely to want to sit through that just to get whatever else was being offered up.

I feel like the main exception to this is when something has achieved ""classic"" or ""appreciation by serious viewers"" status, like *Neon Genesis Evangelion* (not saying *ButaReba* or *Love Flops* are on that level, but NGE is chockfull of stuff that many viewers would not tolerate in any seasonal).

> [ButaReba]

My main favorite bit along those lines is that the MC openly wondered about the possible premise of the show - pondering if he was a pig on the inside as well as a pig on the outside. 

However I'm fairly certain that whatever *ButaReba* has cooking, it's not going to be enough for people who hated the MC's degenerate monologue to sit through it to get to the other stuff.

But at the moment of truth, it doesn't make it less than chore to me. I still don't like Tohru on-screen, like 3/5 eps have me bored, the drama in S3 is so over the top it was hilarious and the only reason I rated it positively is because I enjoyed in the same way one would enjoy a mexican telenovela. 

Just because I recognize that the show has positive attributes, I won't gaslight myself and go 'Ok, I hated watching this but...its a symbolic shoujo guys! 10/10'. If I was in AOTY it would have been my stance that yeah, it has good things but I would rather nominate other shows.

---

**Merging Short Series with Anime of the Year**

This year, Short Series had very few eligible entries, including stuff like CM series and tie-in shorts to full-length TV series. Coupled with lack of interest in this category and the existence of Short Film (which has dramatically more entries), it seemed prudent to merge Short Series with Anime of the Year as they're ultimately still series and separate from the Short Film category.

**Giving Cast 10 nominations**

This is primarly so all category groups have the same number of nominations: 8 for Genre and 10 for Character, Production, and Main. There's also plenty of shows with worthwhile casts this year making it an easy change to allow for.


**Jury Writing Project Changes**

The /r/Anime Awards Jury Discusses project will once again return. In years past, the project has felt like it somewhat fell short of the goal of engaging the community and illustrating the process. That's why this year the project will be tweaked slightly - and that's where you, the members of /r/anime come in. Questions answered by the jury will be sourced from a thread posted in late November once shows are selected by the participating juries (whichever juries we decide). Other than that, the process will be the same - the jurors will watch the anime in its entirety, answer prompts, and form consensus opinions that will be presented in early January.",0

173ye4w,k4830cg,"Just wanted to chime in and give my thumbs up to the juror application questions this year. Last year I was pretty vocal about how the juror application questions were (in my opinion) not very accessible and favored production-focused applicants, and I mentioned wanting the application questions to be as accessible as possible in the future. This year I feel like the application questions are about as accessible and (for the lack of a better word) optimal as they can be, and I think they do a good balancing act of being simple enough to be accessible for applicants while still doing a good job at assessing the applicants' analysis abilities (~~the accidental alliteration~~).

The genres actually seem fairly even this year, maybe the most even it's ever been since the start of the awards. Usually Drama and Romance are among the weakest categories, but this year there's a lot of good entries, and Romance might actually be the most stacked genre this year, and it's definitely the most stacked it's ever been of any year. Suspense seems weak comparatively, which is a surprise, and Comedy as well is a bit on the low side this year. Adventure is pretty stacked as well this year, with all the isekai this year (and quite a few which were well-liked).",0

I can't say I agree with some of these genre allocations for these shows. Like Niehime being in drama over romance, or Tearmoon being in drama over comedy. 

I guess I just don't like Drama as a category in general. It is way too broad and just seems like a catch-all genre for shows that people don't know where to otherwise place. Its similar to Comedy in that way, in which any show that makes a person laugh can be a comedy.",0

I always like the short series category so I am disappointed with this. Guess that's to be expected though after short series got always treated like a joke category by the hosts with completlely arbitrarily applied rules on eligibility.

>What inconsistencies did you find?

The category was supposedly meant for standalone short series yet in the last two years alone we had Fate, the Kaguya OVA (which wasn't even a series but a single episode), Mini Dra and multiple Pokemon entries.   
Which I personally would say goes against the spirit of the category but if ya'll want to allow that's your choice. 

However there is also apparently the rule that if a short spinoff airs the same year as the main show it is ineligible which last year amongst others barred Kakkou no Iikagen from entry yet MiniDra was allowed despite the main series being present with an OVA, Fate/Grand Carnival being allowed despite a Fate movie showing the same year, Pokemon shorts being allowed like...ever or back when it was still combined with short films in one category,  Isekai Quartet being allowed despite for example Re: Zero airing the same year.",5
173ye4w,k4fwxe8,That's exactly my point. This change will make it so that short series will basically be as if they don't exist.,5
173ye4w,k4bmtvx,"Previous years had different rules. Inconsistency between years isn't really relevant.

The combination rule is specifically for TV shows that have another one or two ep OVA follow in the same year that effectively count as more episodes of that TV anime. MiniDra was an exception because we combine with main series not just another smaller OVA. And you can't just combine all Pokemon entries into one as they aren't all part of the same anime even if they're all from the Pokemon franchise. Fate/Grand Carnival is also not just an OVA attached to the Fate movie but its own thing. Isekai Quartet is a complete non-starter, it's not an OVA of Re:Zero at all but its own complete show.

It's fine to have disagreements on allocations but some of these are not inconsistencies but a misunderstanding of our rules.",6
173ye4w,k4brzbj,"You misread my post. Or maybe I didn't make it clear enough that my first point of how those should be ineligible period was a seperate point from the one I was trying to make in the second paragraph.  
I wasn't arguing that those should not be allowed by your current rules but that if those are allowed then Kakkou no Iikagen should have been allowed too. 

It was its own show that simply borrowed the characters from A Couple of Cuckoos, told its own story  and rather than a romcom it was actually an isekai.",7
173ye4w,k4bukun,That OVA is part of an existing full-length TV series and would be combined. MiniDra would've been too had the full Kobayashi series aired that same year.,8

1770qsq,k4pxhdc,"**Frieren's German Lesson 1x6:**

Only one new German word this time but instead we got a lot of amazing dragon fight sakuga with best boy Stark. 

**Episode 6: ""The Hero of the Village""**

**Stark** (the Hero of the Village) - ""strong"" (adjective)

**Riegel** (Canyon) - ""bars"", ""latches"" (noun)  
______________
(The Fortress City of) **Waal** - **Waal** isn't even a real word in German. The only relevant German word I could find is the name of a river from the Rhine that is named **Waal** as well. I doubt the author was going for that.  
  
**Wal** with one ""A"" would be ""whale"" (noun) but I'm very doubtful about this translation. I think **Waal** is also a mistranslation from the Japanese into the English.  
  
It is most likely either **Wall** or even **Wahl** that the author was going for. **Wall** means pretty much the same in English as in German (it is pronounced differently though: /val/ instead of the English /wɔːl/) but it's usually used to talk about fortress walls specifically - i.e. ramparts (a normal wall is called **Wand** in German) and **Wahl** means ""choice"" or ""election"" (noun).  
  
Thematically **Wall** definitely fits the best for a Fortress City so I really doubt that **Waal**, **Wal** or **Wahl** is the correct translation here.  
  
*Thanks to u/Various_Breakfast784 for correcting me on the ""Wal"" spelling. I can't believe I made such a stupid mistake, lol.*

The truth of it was unexpected. The master reacted instinctively out of fear at how strong the student was. That's probably the best thing a student could ever ask for. Stark was acknowledged for his strength, but straight up made Eisen feel fear.

Which brings a cute comparison with how they both tremble is said fear when a strong opponent is before them. It's definitely a healthy reaction; it means you have not gone numb yet to the motions of it all.

The times they shared together when he was a kid were sweet. He brought Stark around, shared stories, and seemed to have treated him really well. Good to see Stark wanting to be able to tell his master about it before he passes on.

Seems like his confidence is already a lot better now, and he already has a great dynamic with Fern by the end of the episode too, even though it started with [Fern teasing him](https://i.imgur.com/bULWsRL.png).",0

Like, most shows do not really pay much attention to things like the sound of the steps when people walk around - but here you can absolutely hear the difference between the surfaces they walk on - it sounds really authentic and has lots of detail, like wood of the stairs audibly creaking when Frieren and Fern walk up to the first floor of the inn in one of the previous episodes.

They also put a lot of care into the ambient sounds, like the wind gently blowing in the background when they're standing in an open space outside, or very natural sounding  forest ambiance.

The sound mix also helps to elevate all these details - it's amazingly well done how they emphasize details in certain scenes and put them more in the background, but still keep them clearly audible in others.",0

It's the scene of Frieren spinning the leaf all over again.

I love how all that badassery concludes with Stark making an ass of himself. His delivery was just too good. For how powerful every member of this party is, they're all just a bunch of goofballs. Hell, their leader is probably the biggest goofball of them all with how she gets excited for useless spells, but gets sad about getting to continue their journey.

But imagine if the loot you got from defeating a boss in an RPG was a god damn 'see-through-clothes' spell. That's... that's probably for a different, more mature genre, now that I think about it. It's a bit sad Himmel wasn't around for them to get the see-through spell. He would've been the most excited about it out of anyone.",0

I liked in general how the episode handled the topic of fear.  Stark wasn't wrong to not provoke the dragon, just like the dragon knew not to provoke him.  It was his fight with an enemy that dangerous -- the scene where we see the scale difference between Stark and the dragon was great -- so it was only smart for him to be afraid, and to wait until he knew he had the tactical advantage of having Frieren on hand.",0

I definitely enjoyed the eye candy fight with the dragon, I'm really glad about Stark's 'growth'. I wished to see what Frieren did to him for the 'old hag' though.

Either way, he's certianly a great addition to the party, his few interactions with Fern are already gold.

And although I knew it already due to the Mimic thing, not deadpan Frieren is honestly a treat. That 'uhyuu' when she raced to the dead dragon's trove and her unwilling facial expression when she realized she was going to be involved in a hassle hero recognination were simply chef kiss. 

There's something about Frieren's overall storytelling that simply makes you feel... as if you're immersed in a mystical sea. Time becomes meaningless and you simply sway with the weaves of the narration.

It even feels magical. 

It feels like a slow, but steady increase in enjoyment, a la their journey pretty much. It's a 'deep' experience I feel. Each moment, each passage, each event is being absorbed, or perhaps it should be better to be said that... it engraves itself in my being way deeper than normal stories. 

That is the bearings of a 'masterpiece' indeed, but it's also definitely due to the truly top notch adaptation.",0

1770qsq,k4r6hx5,"I love how chill this show is but the progression maintains a nice pace. You get to see and feel the characters live while also getting to see cool fight scenes.   
  
This story is very interesting in setting the story after most stories “main story” of the hero’s party defeating the big bad antagonist. We didn’t get to see the hero’s party’s journey nor see their character throughout, but I love these glimpses into the past that we get. People romanticize the party that saved the world but we get to see Frieren’s memories showing that the hero’s party wasn’t perfect – in this episode we get to see that even Eisen was afraid (as he should be) to be facing a giant dangerous creature.   
  
The animation during the dragon fight was really cool and I love how they put so much care into little parts – specifically Stark’s hand when he was clinging onto the dragon. The hand animations are so tender, like when Fern was sitting down on the stool in this episode or when Frieren was cradling the blue moon weed flower in the second episode. The music is also amazing at elevating the scenes. At the beginning, Stark mentions how much of a disappointment he is to his master; the dialogue during the fight resolved that as well as put a lot of weight on Stark’s capability by providing us with the knowledge that the dragon was afraid of him and that he was able to kill the dragon in roughly 30 seconds. It’s also stunning that even Eisen, the master and a member of the hero’s party, was afraid of Stark.   
  
The little bit of dialogue during the flashback of the shaved ice was also interesting. It’s understood that obviously the party that defeated the Demon King is powerful, but Eisen provides more perspective on the team’s ability if the Hero of the South, the strongest fighter, was killed – not by the Demon King – but the Seven Sages of Destruction. The conversation stresses that the accomplishments of the hero’s party was not a walk in the park, even though we get to see a lot of fun and cute moments, like the shaved ice, the rock puppet, and the flower crowns.   
  
I think it’s pretty unique and bold that Yamada intentionally chose not to show us the hero’s journey but the story afterward with an emphasis on the passage of time. I love the glimpses that we get of the party’s adventures via flashbacks and I also love that we get to see the epilogue – which you never get to fully see when a main story is over. It makes the flashbacks feel so much more valuable. The only thing I still wonder about is how the party fought giant creatures – I’d especially like to know what sort of role Heiter played. Usually the priest is the designated healer but it doesn’t seem like healing magic is commonplace in this world unless I missed something. I’m sure it will be shown eventually.",0

Ahh. Getting to watch this feels so surreal.

The Eisen/Stark flashback, where Stark speaks so fondly of Eisen's love for this journey, is imo what the entire series is about. As sad as it is to look back on people who are gone, the way this series frames each experience is so fond and cherished. Even the smallest, most benign moments make an impact. It was such a small, sweet moment but man did it just fill me with such glee.

1776y29,k4sm9ti,"Very few anime grips me in the way this series already has in the first 2 episodes. Not even chainsaw man or jujutsu kaisen. 

I already love a lot of things about this series so far. The whole whimsical tone where the most bizarre and macabre  scenarios are treated in such a casual manner, the avoidance of melodrama, the goofy art style, the unorthodox powers, the way individual, standalone powers like regeneration or bad luck curse are handled in such created ways(sort of like MHA in that regard but even more big brained), etc. The main duo is already very likeable, fun to watch and has great chemistry. I also really appreciate how much actual STRATEGY is present in fights. Like when we see the fake out hand Andy used as a decoy to bait out the mech guy, then using regeneration powers to remotely kill him off despite having his movement disabled. This is something that I feel is becoming increasingly rare in modern shonen, even in ones which specialise in their fights like JJK where it usually boils down to ""I am more powerful, I win"". And at the same time, there is minimal technobabble about how powers work.

All i'll say is this is going to be one hell of a ride!",0
1776y29,k4r54kk,another great episode,0
1776y29,k4r0w78,"On the one hand, Fuko has finally found someone who can withstand her Unluck and maybe cure her of her loneliness...on the other hand, he wants to get into her pants for the purpose of killing himself. What's a girl to do? Well, other than telling him he better properly romance her instead of forcing himself on her otherwise he'll never get that (un)lucky because she'll hate him instead of like him enough for it to work.  
  
We finally get the OP! A very colorful and stylized OP featuring Fuko, And, and the various characters they will meet along the way during their journey.   
  
Andy definitely has resources, I guess it just comes with the territory of living for a long time, and he's got Fuko all geared up for their race to outrun the Union who can't let two rogue Negators loose on the world. What a pair of outlaws these two make.  
  
Of course the Union DOES find them and they get accosted by a giant mecha in a suit and Natuski Hanae as a friendly Chinese dude named Shen, and both come with their own Negator abilities that put Andy and Fuko in a bind. But what a hardcore way to get into a fistfight with a robot Andy.  
  
Clever Fuko! Finding them a means of escaping the Union by JOINING the Union, even if it means killing off two members.  
  
I love how Fuko gets all tsundere trying to downplay her feelings for Andy when she's so charmed by him that just a single hand on his torso is enough to bring out a tanker and land them conveniently in a condemned building scheduled to be demolished and filled with dynamite. That's some Wicked Sick Unluck!  
  
Sorry Unavoidable, your power made it so that you could negate anyone's muscle so they couldn't avoid your attack, but you couldn't negate Andy's headshotting finger bullet.  
  
Shen has some kind of power to make someone act opposite to their intentions, which is useful for deflecting in a fight, though despite that Andy is still able to keep up with him which earns Shen's respect. And Fuko tries to grab him because she means well but misses the point that she was more useful when he couldn't see her. But don't get discouraged Fuko!  
  
That's classy of Andy to give Fuko a spot in the Union and being willing to get taken again in the process...but Andy's like the first guy she's really bonded with at all so she's willing to sleep with him then and there if this is her only chance at sex. But such a display is enough to let Shen give them a chance at defeating another Union member in three days, so there's still a chance! And good thing Andy's not the type to take advantage of a desperate girl.  
  
So it's off to Russia by land, sea, and air! Where Andy will hook up with his old war buddies (what war!?) and Fuko will get to taste Russian Vodka! Also, will Andy be able to keep any pants?  
  
The ED is pretty melancholic yet serene with Andy on the river styx (seemingly) but also in the company of a woman. Someone from his past? Lady Death? Either way, he still wakes up to Fuko in the end.",0
1776y29,k4rcr5v,"I didn't know that [the opening will be by Queen Bee!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stzAsF51T_w) That's sick! Wicked sick! Genuinely tearing up seeing characters I know and love in the OP. I can't wait to meet them soon in future episodes. <3

Speaking of characters I know and love, [Shen is here!](https://i.imgur.com/B3ecAzM.jpg) I love how casual he is to Fuuko despite being tasked to hunt them down. [Void's here too](https://i.imgur.com/0a4AeEG.jpg) who is absolutely brutal [against Andy during their fistfight.](https://i.imgur.com/4uxLeLw.jpg) 

Big robot man is cool too [as well as his Unavoidable ability](https://i.imgur.com/fXnKA6E.jpg) but man, [I forgot how cold-blooded Void's death is](https://i.imgur.com/7KnDKJ7.jpg) once Andy figures out how his Unavoidable ability works. Not even [an ounce of remorse from Andy](https://i.imgur.com/kk86T7p.jpg) after he shoots Void point blank with his Parts Bullet. 

As nice as it was [for Fuuko to show off the goods](https://i.imgur.com/v9N070B.jpg) this episode, that scene always made me uncomfortable considering how she's [willing to fuck in the middle of the street](https://i.imgur.com/Gw598eI.jpg) so they could escape Shen. Andy might be a bit of a scumbag [but he's not that kind of scumbag.](https://i.imgur.com/0SQ69Rj.jpg)

At least [Shen was very much amused by Fuko's antics](https://i.imgur.com/lmufHDm.jpg) that he even gave them a tip on where to find another Negator they can eliminate to guarantee both of them seats in the Union. Welp, we're off to Russia next week!",0

Last episode made it seem like a whinny asshole who just wants to die. But reiterating his self sacrificing nature while adding his love for Vodka make him seem more human. Yeah he's immortal and wants to die but that doesn't mean he hasn't enjoyed a bunch of things on his (long) life and can continue doing so. He's just probably tired of it all.

Also I kinda doubt these 10 Union guys are gonna become a happy go lucky crew for Fuko and Andy considering how little the value of life seems to have for them. Shen didn't bated an eye after Void got killed and immediately offered the life of another Union member to help our MC's.

The animation in those parts is great of course- they do justice to the creative and dynamic way Andy makes use of his power- but the sound effects are meaty as hell too, and that was also one of my favorite details in Fire Force.

Void looks and sounds badass, but it's such a shame he was only around for one episode. I didn't expect Natsuki Hanae to voice Shen, but he definitely makes him sound more like the affable goofball he should be.

Fuuko continues to be a sweet cinnamon roll, and my favorite moment was her angrily grinding her teeth against Shen. You'd think she'd be a lot more fearful considering these guys came to kill or capture them.

Also, even though there's more emphasis in Andy very quickly analyzing and countering their enemies' powers, I liked the part at the beginning where Fuuko quickly figures out an aspect of her own powers. It doesn't seem like she knew it relied on likability until that very moment where she needed a way to escape.

1776y29,k4rojes,"He broke the skin when he bit his finger, triggering his negation. He has a degree of influence over it and so, instead of simply sealing the cut, he generated an entire finger tip.

Basically, he thought of his entire finger as dead due to one small cut and generated a new one in it's place. Undead is a cosmic law, part of him being considered dead simply doesn't work with the way the universe works, so the new part appears literally instantly. The two parts can't overlap, so the old one gets rocketed out. It's kind of like how the intangible guy in MHA moves around.",1

You know despite the fact that they sent a death squad after them this Union does have a point.

While the story hasn't gone into it very deeply at this time, it is rather sad to consider that Fuuko has never experienced any form of physical intimacy since a young age. Yes, this episode focused on the more erotic aspects like sex, but she has never been able to touch her family's hands without gloves, give her grandparents a kiss, or any other kind of skin-to-skin contact.

It seems like there's some good in him, but due to his situation, he's become past giving a shit at this point and that leads to him doing some horrible stuff to Fuuko. Even Shen noted the humanity in him when he hesitated a little in taking a life even after countless years of living and presumably killing.

And maybe Fuuko's attempted sacrifice made him change his mind and regain some more of that humanity. Perhaps it made him think ""he's supposed to be better than this"" or something.",2

Fuuko's Unluck doesn't create things such as meteors or gasoline tankers, it just alters probability so that bad things happen involving them. If there hadn't been a building scheduled for demolition her Unluck would have likely resulted in something else bad happening to Andy.",4

The larger reason is likely B, but even so she's only doing so because she feels like she owes him for saving her life by giving his spot to her and because she doesn't want him to go through 10 years of tests again. But she's still forcing herself to, as she didn't want to at the start of this episode. Andy doesn't want her to have sex out of a feeling of debt, as that wouldn't be of her own volition, which is why he reacted so negatively.",5
1776y29,k4sp7z5,"She is definitely motivated by her circumstances.

Her power is making her miserable, so she's taking agency and choosing to sacrifice something she wouldn't be willing to part with if she had a normal life.

TL;DR. She's been desperate since her parents died.  You can see this from the simple fact that she was intending to commit suicide in episode 1.

Also, sex won't kill him, sex isn't love after all.  Only way to die is to have the character fall in love, only way to achieve that is to protect and treat with kindness.",5
1776y29,k4sc7h4,What if someone's ability is Undress though?,5
1776y29,k4si757,"It seemed pretty clear to me that she was lying about her motivations. She actually wanted to do it, but can't just come out and say that because...society? Being an awkward 18 year old? Take  your pick.

Just because she didn't want to at the start of the episode doesn't mean she couldn't have changed her mind by the end of the episode.

Andy didn't give a shit about that ""own volition"" stuff earlier. He continually chases her while she is screaming no at the end of the first episode. The only reason he relents is when she says it won't work unless she likes him. I think it is just poor and inconsistent writing. Doing some Pepé Le Pew shit for some cheap laughs when it doesn't actually reflect how you want the character to be portrayed.",6
1776y29,k4suj9e,"Nothing wrong with being motivated by circumstances.

Are you talking about her virginity? I find thinking of it as a ""sacrifice"" fairly disgusting.

She's desperate for contact. He's desperate for death.

We don't know if any of that is true. She doesn't know how her own powers work since it is fairly hard to test them out. If a haircut was enough to call down a building destroying meteor it stands to reason that an orgasm could be enough to up that exponentially. I mean it likely means she calls down a dinosaur extinction level event based on what we have seen so far.",6

Deep breaths. Okay the trailers were kinda terrible as they didnt really show off what makes the show so fun-hell, despite being really fucking great, neither did the first episode.

Also I like how story is told between the lines, not explaining every single thing, nuanced.

And the running jokes have that feel to them, they're not very funny, but they're those jokes you have with your friends that warms your heart every time it's repeated.

176zqnz,k4qic8t,"I've read the manga and seen the first episode. It's not your typical harem manga at all; he is actually dating all 100 girls. So it contains almost every character trope, but almost none of the plot ones, as, well, he's dating 100 girls, can't really have the love triangle angle or anything like that. It's very funny, and breaks the fourth wall quite a lot, which is fantastically carried over to the anime, with characters not wanting their lines cut in the anime adaptation, skipping forward and Rentarou telling two girls he will respond to their feelings after the commercial break.

As for pacing, it moves fairly briskly towards the end goal, which is for Rentarou to date 100 girls, while his relationship with the current girlfriends improve and deepen, but you can't really compare that with the will-they-wont-they from a normal harem. The potential for deep character development is also of course cut short by how large the cast is, but I think they have done a fantastic job with all the girls, I like every single of them to various degrees.

I definitely think you should give it a shot, it's a good parody of the genre and every girl is best girl.

(For real, they had a popularity poll but the MC submitted 999999 votes for every one of his girlfriends so they all won first place)",2
176zqnz,k4qjwrz,"its good and it's a slice of life rom com where no girls ever loses and have growth between each girl as they get to know each other and there crazy shit that happens like the girls having to go cold turkey on salad. like, in the sub and comments on other sites, ppl were asking this same question when about to check it out.",2
176zqnz,k4svc6f,"One of the taglines the Manga uses is translated to 'The naive harem rom-com with zero loosing heroines'.

Part of the joy of the show is that no girl is going to be disappointed, or unloved. Sure they're all sharing the same boy, but it works out strangely well in large part due to Rentarou's superhuman desire and ability to make his girls happy. The gfs genuinely get along. There's no usual trappings of romance shows because there's no need for them. 

Part of the charm is the episodes that focus on a small group of girls, or a solo date, or even a chapter here and there with just the girls carrying the story. There's really interesting combinations of personality quirks that happen as you add more and more people to the mix. 

There are genuinely sweet romance moments,  gag chapters based on the most absurd premises, descents into complete lunacy, and the ever hyped new girl chapters.

It's definitely something that has a formula that develops and improves as it gets going, but I still look fondly on the beginning of the series.

It's not going to appeal to everyone, but if you like romance, hate waiting for the couple to say I love you /hold hands /kiss, etc, hate treading water because the excuses for preventing progress are getting more and more dumb because any sort of commitment spells the end of the series, you'll enjoy this if you give it a shot.

Also, yes. Literally the only reason given, as of episode one, as to why humanity needs to wipe witches out, is that somehow they need their dignity back?

I would start at 32, but it's too early for most people - this when they ""execute"" the king and the princess. You will get a lot of extra bits if you start there. Skimming through the manga is also fine, but some important concepts are introduced during that season like Guardian Beasts and Vassal weapons.

He removed his helmet when Priestess asked him to at the end of last season while thinking of her words of support. For a brief moment he did not see the world anymore through the helmet, he is not powerless anymore, he has companions... friends.

We're now in Episode 2 and I have not seen a hint of GS being a 3D model [especially during the fight scenes.](https://i.imgur.com/OUDi7h8.png) LIDENFILMS is doing good so far IMO.

I'm sure they know it's a trap, not that it matters. Yea, Goblin Slayer tends to not have problems with non-goblins for some reason lol. Usually one shots em with ingenuity. Love how he's like ""you're not a goblin?"" lol. Least kid realized he's wrong about her and was about to apologize. Still a brat with much to learn. Do love how Goblin Slayer applies various things he learns. Hehe, why, kid? Goblin Slayer is a badass dude. He just has a fixation on goblins for good reason. 

Dunno how you think you could handle those goblins if you have such limited spells. Lizardman is great. Oh we learn about the kid having a big sis. And it's someone we've met.

Sure, you lost your sister. Others mocked her because of it. But why do you have to be an asshole to those who said no such thing? Goblin Slayer went through the same thing, but look at him.

Go ahead and die in a solo adventure then, by all means. Those who refuse to learn are, if anything, a danger to those who are willing. I have no sympathy for him. Fucking prick.

That scene when Lizard Priest [mentions his race origins](https://i.imgur.com/3VjCWgx.png) was funny.

I fear for Wizard Boy's virginity.

It's an interesting contrast to show [goblins acting like mischievous imps, considering what we know about their evil and all.](https://imgur.com/ROYuagC)

And so Priestess will have her first mission, as a leader anyway! 

She did a fine job in the 'pre-mission', [asking questions to figure out what they're up against!](https://imgur.com/6Im3zAp)

[Elf and Dwarf's constant bickering will always be funny!](https://imgur.com/s2vzavJ)

[Wizard boy's dismissal of goblins is reminiscent of a certain party in the first season's opener!](https://imgur.com/r3D9vyH)

Thankfully he has a solid party around him, or he'd be 100% dead in his first adventure.

[Loved Elf's bratty smile there! She may be action-minded, but at least she's still fine with using strategies, like covering their scent!](https://imgur.com/iPLqRI2)

[Blocking door's pretty smart too! Lets you deal with a few of them at once, instead of them coming from all sides.](https://imgur.com/3J3ERdV)

Wizard boy's not a big fan of strategizing though, or patience... [He already wanted to use spells for no reason, thankfully Priestess stopped him!](https://imgur.com/vSpuow0)

He may need these spells later on, so letting the warrior-types deal with these lone goblins is the right move. Sadly, it doesn't seem like Wizard-boy is interested in doing ""the right move"", he's more about getting the glory for himself or something? Or maybe just the sense of adventure, he wants to take part in the fighting, not just let Goblin Slayer/Lizardman do everything.

That may be commendable, BUT when it causes him to rush in like an idiot, then it turns into a burden... 

[Oh, the Goblins just wanted to do some modern art sculpture!](https://imgur.com/GbdhPOC)

Wizard-boy used his spell to kill one random goblin, [and then rushed in to save the girl...](https://imgur.com/FpQVAtL)

His heart's in the right place, but they'd need a large cemetery to bury all these reckless 'adventurers with their heart in the right place'!

When he realized he fell into the trap and was about to die, [he tried to get them to stay away, but they came in anyway;](https://imgur.com/O457Dly)

That's why patience is important (even when pressed by a kidnapped girl)... You rush in because you want to save the victim, then they rush in to save you, when they otherwise might have wanted to move in with more caution.

[He refused to learn some ""weak"" spells, that may actually have been useful. Hopefully hanging out with Goblin Slayer helps him see things differently!](https://imgur.com/opg5PJG)

Priestess did a fine job in her first mission as a leader, but [she still had her moments of doubts...](https://imgur.com/FeO6H8e)

That's why it's a good thing she went to her mission with an actual good leader/strategist! Knowing what to do 9 times out of 10 can still be deadly for the 10th thing... But Goblin Slayer can take over for this one, so everyone's safe! 

Whether it's for a normal adventure or a leadership-training mission, always helps to be with someone who's seen it all!

Wizard-boy sees things differently though, [and won't acknowledge Goblin Slayer...](https://imgur.com/RpB9Mf7)

Boy, he's the only reason you're still alive!

We then learned about his backstory, he lost a sister (made him relatable to Goblin Slayer), but more than that, [Wizard-girl was his sister!](https://imgur.com/30cMA1k)

Which means that... Goblin Slayer killed his sister? Well, it's not an accurate portrayal of the situation of course (it was a mercy), but Wizard-boy (being emotionally invested, AND being brash in general) may see it differently. 

Conflict brewing between Goblin Slayer and Wizard-boy? At least Priestess will be there to explain how it went, but given she's so close to Goblin Slayer, Wizard-boy may think she's just taking his side and all.

Anyway, that was a fun episode again! And while Wizard-boy was still a bit infuriating at times, I'm beginning to think redemption may be possible for him, if he starts listening to his teammates a little!",0

I tried to point out a few aspects in which the episode was lacking in the previous episode discussion, honestly I had completely lost hope that the second season will be any good.

But holy shit, its like the second episode was made by an entirely new team, 
the animation looks a lot better, comparable to season 1, the character look pretty consistent in each shot, the dialog is well written, and even the comedy wasn't bad.

I really loved the first season and the movie, 
and I just wanted to root for the second season so much.
After 5 long years of anticipation, and delayed schedules.

The second episode was the level of quality that this show really deserve, Im really hyped to see what is to come next. I really hope they keep up the good work.

Letting Priestess call the shots was a cool experiment. When I used to be seriously into raiding in ESO, I liked to pick someone who was still learning to try and call the mechanics for the group once they'd experienced the fights a few times.

I really hate when writers choose this archetype. Writers typically don't give them enough of an actual personality to write a satisfying ""moving on"" epilogue. So the audience has to sit through a bunch of toxicity with zero payoff.

* The captured Priestess was nude obviously
* The first trap behind the door had the body parts of the first party
* Would have loved to have Wizzard Boys thoughts, that he wasted his single spell and that the Goblins made the Girl scream to lure them into a trap, made his hubris that he ignored all the warnings and that he should at least warn the rest of the party more pronounced
* The captured girl got her fingers chopped off by the Goblins, and it fell on Wizzard Boy to collect them so that they could get reatached

Also good insures in case things go south. And since her party knows her they are more willing to follow her orders, imagine a whole party of headstrong idiots like the Wizzard or her Party from Ep1

""Why should we be cautious? It's just Goblins!""",1
176ytyl,k4ssi33,"> Damn hes the younger brother of the Wizard who died in ep 1 of S1

Not only that... Wizard Girl was suffering from the poison, and GS was the one who gave her a sending off at her request. So in GS's POV he was the one who killed his sister, something he regrets because he was too late.

In episode 1 of this season, he takes ALL the goblin quests, even the ones that have been already taken and prioritises them. He's actually goes to check on all the inexperienced parties to make sure they make it out ok.",1
176ytyl,k4pre6l,He is lucky that he had not further things taken from him since he was in luck with meeting both guild girl and goblin slayer who care strongly for people. Other adventures would have just say its choice going solo to his own doom. Also there party already has experienced with reckless kids with the fencer merchant.,1

176ytyl,k4s0uvf,"Yeah he's so unlikeable.

Made me think of a moral question: if an unlikeable dumb character with a sad backstory like him died due to his own action, would you cherish the death or would you pity him instead?",1
176ytyl,k4pkim9,I am constantly wondering how often he showers/bathes and worried about his hygiene,1

This was supposed to be one of the most emotional and heartbreaking moments of the series, but the anime didn't deliver the right emotions for it. They rushed what should've been a really somber and rare moment of vulnerability for GS.",1

its more than that, remember, Goblin Slayer is the one that dealt the finishing blow to Rookie Wizard's sister, sure, its mercy killing but its still affected his mental state",1
176ytyl,k4popk3,"> And also good job on Priestess, that was not an easy first job as leader.

Yeah, if she didn't had a Party member that was constantly ignoring all her plans, she would have made it way better, only when they encountered the troll did she loose her head, but she got the basics of Goblin Slaying down to a T",1

Inexperience. A woman is being tortured so he rushes in to save her, with no situational awareness or longer term planning. So basically a rookie making rookie mistakes.",2

But Wizard is green and recently lost his sister to goblins, so when he heard the screams, he ran to acolyte as if it were his sister in danger.  He hasn't learned that goblins are dangerous and has been conditioned to believe that they are harmless, because of all the mockery his sister got from the guys at the academy.

That said, it doesn't really explain the attitude after the quest.  I guess he's just being stubborn or trying to work through his cognitive dissonance.  Or maybe he's tsundere and wants to be GS's waifu.",2

The magic casters are like Megumi but without the cast a day being a fucking nuke. People thought she was still useless even with the kill almost everything any level nuke. I get cast limits are to make goblin slayer more creative, but when you look at other parties goblins being viewed as weak falls way way apart with low spell count cast limits.

That was even the case for DND. and yes you most likly will carried a lot as clerics and mages at the start. Later you could also use magic items to help out.,3
176ytyl,k4q9m5z,"Yeah, spellcasters seem to be atrocious early on... 

*Witch* shows us it's possible to make it and become a legit asset (having massive AoE effect spells), but in their early levels, give me 5 good warriors anytime, over a party of spellcasters and stuff!

Support Spells (like Holy Light) have their uses, but it's still just ""something to support the actual warriors"".

If Goblin Slayer was a videogame, casters would be underpowered as hell in the early game!",3
176ytyl,k4qmul1,"The spellcasters in Goblin Slayer need to go to Kimberly Magic Academy and learn how to use a sword.

If all you got is one spell a day, you absolutely need to get some other combat skills.",3
176ytyl,k4qdp6k,I imagine most magic casters start with some sort of side arm and only become pure magic casters once the reach a higher rank and are able to cast more spells per day.,3
176ytyl,k4qjc0p,"Only the hero could cast multiple spells a day at level 1

Everyone else needs to level up over time. Thankfully staffs still work as clubs and the spell can be useful for taking out large mobs or the boss of the dungeon",3
176ytyl,k4qtxm5,"There's a reason that all early era Level 1 D&D Wizards buy a Crossbow with their starting funds and get at least 12 DEX for a +1 to hit on it. 

Once you've fired your 3-5 Magic Missiles for the day, you're done otherwise (well you have 3-5 if you build a Wizard right; since he clearly also doesn't have bonus spells if he has just 1 cast). 

Goblin Slayer is very much based on an earlier D&D setting like this.",3
176ytyl,k4pyihf,">The magic casters are like Megumi but without the cast a day being a fucking nuke.

Megumin is useless as an adventurer, as they are going to be fighting limited battles in close quarters. OTOH if you are a commander of an army she would be infinitely useful.

Unless you are the Russian Army, you don't use grenades during hostage rescue.",3
176ytyl,k4puege,"To be fair, Megumin wasn’t useful either if the story was remotely serious. She would have gotten the team killed over and over. In fact, Kazuma died a dozen times already. 

If Konosuba was like Re:Zero, it would have been 10000x more tragic, resulting from her being a deadweight after one cast and the incompetency from the rest of the cast (except for Kazuma).",3
176ytyl,k4rei82,"Honestly, I feel like being a spell caster is just awful because casting one spell a day put you in a disadvantage in a long drawn out battle.",3

176ytyl,k4t67hp,"He didn't seem to be carrying any weapons nor have any other notable skills. The weird thing is he gave an impression of being intelligent until he started mocking Priestess last episode. He wanted to actually learn about goblins and how to kill them rather than just try to get the first quest. 


But the moment he started being antagonistic, everything seemed to go down. Capable of only one spell a day, no other weapon, nothing else to contribute, and still talking shit about how he could have taken the goblins.",3

176ytyl,k4sf412,"Agreed. Just let things breathe, let some shots linger, and let information slowly and naturally sink in. Maybe don't put any music when GS realizes who Wizard Boy's sister is. Maybe have him walk slower. Maybe put actual emotion into his voice (we saw that in the manga). They flat out did not add anything to capture the importance and emotion of this moment.",3
176ytyl,k4s4ruj,"Because he was the one who euthanized Wizard Boy's older sister. He was the one that made sure she couldn't come back. It wasn't frustration. It was guilt. We know that GS was justified in doing that because Wizard boy's sister was going through unspeakable pain, it was mercy. But fact of the matter is, GS never even entertained the possibility that she could be saved. He just brushed it aside. At the time, GS never even considered how her death would affect other people. Let alone a younger brother. 

It's consistently brought up in the manga and LN how GS is barely human, how he's slowly turning into the same monsters he's been killing. In every waking moment, he's just focused on killing and slaughtering goblins in the most gruesome ways possible. Nothing else. 

But it was this moment where we saw that GS is still human. He was looking down on the boy the moment he showed up. But now, it's different. In his mind, he thought he accomplished something, but he was just an idiot who couldn't do one thing right. This was a sin that came back to bite him, and he knows he has to atone.",3

176ytyl,k4t4zxh,"Right? If you're going to explore such themes, then don't pussy out in actually showing shit. Be it dead bodies, nudity, torture, rape, or whatever else.",4
176ytyl,k4qlwnm,What about volume 3&4 ?,4
176ytyl,k4qp6l4,"Motoyasu was so close to being redeemable as a fool that's getting used for being gullible... and then he tried to lock Firo in her human ""little angelic"" form with a VERY disturbing grin on his face",4
176ytyl,k4r1qgs,I will concede that Adolin is pretty awesome.,4
176ytyl,k4sqlwr,You rely on your party and save your spell for important targets,4
176ytyl,k4sznom,"**First**, relying on your party. The scene in the first episode where he bitched about other classes was extra shitty since mages usually rely heavily on the people he seemingly had no respect for.   


**Second**, pick up enough combat experience in another style so you aren't completely dead weight before and after your likely single spell cast.   


**Third**, preparation of magic tools or spells. In the first season it seems spells can be stored in scrolls for later use. I don't know how affordable or efficient this is so it might be out of this kid's ability.   


**Fourth**, pick up non combat tasks. Leading, navigating, managing materials, and other tasks that are needed for completing commissions often fall on the mage, healer, and other supports for efficiency.   


If a mage does some or all of these things they will likely be making the rest of the party members' lives much easier so they will ignore the fact most of the time they are dead weight.",4
176ytyl,k4t4apd,"This is inspired by old style D&D game (before 4th edition) where wizards could cast spells from spell slots (for memorised spells) and level 1 wizards have only 1 slot per day (2, if your Intelligence stat is high) and unlike latter editions there were no cantrips or they do miserable damage.

If you were playing wizards in an old D&D campaigns, you rely on your teammate to level up, magic items and darts or slings. You can watch a play though of Baldur’s Gate 2  to see how it’s like, but a solo wizard player was tough (you could die to the tutorial rat fight if RNG is not on your side)",4
176ytyl,k4tcxql,"> Thats only 2 targets PER DAY MAX.

Depends a bit on what spells are used. For example, the Fireball spell he used is technically an AoE spell. He just wasted it on a goblin with no other goblins nearby. So pick spells that are multi-target or AoE and he could hit more targets than he has spell uses.",4
176ytyl,k4soz5f,I dunno?  Bullies like to use anything to torment their victims.,4
176ytyl,k4svcvo,"But goblins are just cannon fodder. You must be stupid to get killed by them.
-Pretty much every person that are too proud both in-universe and even RL tabletop gamers.",4
176ytyl,k4psi6o,yeah but magic casters here are spell reliant with out cqc,4
176ytyl,k4qveza,"It looks like spell casters are broken in end game though. If Priestess ever gets light rays or something, all she’s need to do is set up on protection and she can just orbital bombard in complete safety.",4
176ytyl,k4qzap3,"The redeeming thing might be the ability to make their own enchants or potions, but that would require planning well ahead for any mission. At least it seems such items are able to make up for limited spell-casting on its own in this world. (And it seems even non-magic users in the party may be able to use some.)",4
176ytyl,k4r5npi,"So kinda like Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 edition, or Pathfinder 1st edition. Where you had cantrips, but they only dealt 1d3 damage (unless you used homebrewed scaling cantrip rules: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XNgxsZwfWU4QQHTSIA9UInIaSkgb7uiI/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XNgxsZwfWU4QQHTSIA9UInIaSkgb7uiI/view) ). There elves were great spellcasters as early on they could use items like bows and rapiers due to their racial weapon proficiency. Later on spellcasters could kick some serious ass. Though martials weren't exactly useless late game either, just not with as many amazing ground breaking magical spells (martials could use the Book of 9 Swords from D&D 3.5, or Path of war from Pathfinder 1E, which allowed them to use maneuvers, sort of like borderline supernatural weapon attacks that costed a lot of stamina so you couldn't spam them, but you could use them more often than spells).",4
176ytyl,k4r1799,"3-5 magical casts is way more than 1. I can attack a group then kill a troll or other high level enemies with 3 casts. The way goblin slayer is adventures have 2 choices kill rats till they get enough exp to cast more than once, and buy potions. Then still have a hard ass time after because even for that first year they are only going to have 2 casts that also take time to cast till they rank up higher. Or Take over a dungeon someone else failed to clear. Basically till high leveled the first group in this series on a dungeon is going to have a bad time. The seasoned vets in this series get by for the most part because they are almost always 3rd partying a raid some other group already failed.",4

This whole Shino situation is pretty hilarious. It’ll be fun to see how her and Nagisa get along. Deep down, it’s clear she’s envious of Nagisa getting to be the second in this thruple. She just needs to give in and join the Naoya goofball harem!",0

17761ot,k4qyqwb,"""I'm going to make sure they have the best two-timing experience ever!"" - Words I don't think any human has ever uttered before.   
  
Shino is moving in! With both a desire to end this two-timing relationship and get over her own love for Naoya (which is easier said than done), but she also has to clean up after Sakisaki as always.  
  
How did Shino and Saki become friends? Middle school flashback time! Shino had it all...brains, athletics, and composure. But what did Saki see? A cute girl with boobs smaller than hers, meaning she's not a threat and perfect to obsess over. And what does Saki care that Shino is more prestigious? She just wants to hang out with her. And Shino can't help but be charmed by Saki's endearing and honest stupidity.  
  
And as far how she fell for Naoya...she was there through his entire middle school life of confessing to Saki and getting beaten by her on a daily basis, but she saw how sincere he was and couldn't help but be charmed by him. To the point where eventually she wanted to chip in and help him with Saki, and her feelings only deepened for him from there.  
  
Shopping for a gift for Saki and treating us to Shino in that dress? Naoya really does have a way with the ladies, especially when romcom hijinks land him and Shino in the same dressing room with Shino wearing nothing but a shirt and panythose (and the camera makes sure to show off her butt)...with their butts pressed together...and then Naoya gets a good view of her in front. Lucky dog even back then.  
  
Dang, Shino straight up said if they got closer she'd probably fall for him, and that's why they should keep some distance from each other...and Naoya's reaction being wracked with what he would do if that happened basically foreshadowed his future dynamic with Nagisa after she confessed. In another life, his two-timing could've been between Saki and Shino!  
  
Shino can't help herself. She tries to kiss Naoya while he's sleeping. And who should catch them but Saki, though thankfully Shino's entire intelligence came up with such a clear and obvious solution as plucking his nosehair and Saki is so dumb she believes it.  
  
Shino shower scene! Girl needs to collect herself and how bad she is for Naoya, but of course who should walk in and catch her naked (again) but Naoya. Only this time he's ready to turn himself in for the crime of catching her naked and she has to fight against him and landing the two on top of each other with Shino wearing nothing (again). And of course Saki catches them (again). It still didn't go in this time Sakisaki!  
  
Not even Shino can resist Nagisa's puppy dog eyes and and her delicious dinner, and despite herself she can't help but give Nagisa more tips in making a proper nutritional meal. But even if Shino hates her and shuns her, and even if this two-timing relationship is hard on Saki, Nagisa won't give up on Naoya. And it seems like Shino resents Nagisa not only for what she's putting Saki through but for having the guts Shino lacked to act on her feelings for Naoya.  
  
What was Mirika doing, you ask? Still complaining about her lack of screentime and dragging her sister on camping trips with less than stellar cooking to make vids of. Also of course Saki watches Risa's video.

We all knew this was coming, but [Shino finally admitted that she has feelings for Naoya!](https://imgur.com/3naNCow)

(well, she admitted it to us/herself!)

One thing I did NOT expect though, is that her feelings aren't a recent thing! I thought she would progressively grow in love with him over the course of her staying at their place, but no, she has been in love with him for a while already, even before he started dating Saki Saki! This may explain why she resents Nagisa so much (on top of her 'stealing' Saki's love)... Shino felt something for him even before Saki did, but Nagisa made her move when they were already dating. So from Shino's perspective, she has done nothing wrong. Well, up until that episode, anyway, trying to kiss him and all!

She's already being a little bossy, [thinking they're way too relaxed, ](https://imgur.com/t4FIrlD) [way too messy, and trying to bring them back to order!](https://imgur.com/5u4ayP1)

Nagisa's already annoyed, [and wonders how they even became friends;](https://imgur.com/RGoVuDK)


[OF COURSE it started when Saki Saki called her cute!](https://imgur.com/y0ez7hX)

That, and making a reference to Shino's small boobs every other line, [pissing her off right off the bat!](https://imgur.com/8r7rFLS)

Shino actually witnessed the whole thing between Saki and Naoya, with him confessing time and time again, [and Saki rejecting him harshly. (""Pushed him down a cliff"" harshly!)](https://imgur.com/dL6vAkh)

But even if he was actually hitting on someone else, [Shino noticed the good about him, and fell a little for him!](https://imgur.com/f2yEHTh)

[*Why not try something else, like I don't know, hitting on me instead?*](https://imgur.com/WcJqFhB)

Well, he didn't hit on her, [but he did call her cute, that's something!](https://imgur.com/iqEzjFt)

Though when it comes to ""finding everything that moves cute"", Naoyo is #2, right after Saki. 

[Kiss him to move on? That doesn't sound like a smart plan, miss model student!](https://imgur.com/4vVDAPf)

Thankfully Saki's too dumb to figure out the obvious lies Shino fed her, so there wasn't any drama! 

She was a bit distracted too, [coming home early to check out Risa's stream (who she think is cute - obviously)](https://imgur.com/8WlVsXn)

I wonder how she'll feel about it, should Risa ever start flirting with Naoya too! (Unlikely to happen, but to be honest I'm sure if she's supposed to be like a couple years younger than they are, or like 8).

I'm also wondering about how Saki would feel if (way more likely to happen) Shino x Naoya happened! Nagisa was out of the blue, but Shino's her friend... Will that count for something? Or will it make it worse, 'being betrayed by a friend being worse than being betrayed by an enemy/unknown'?

We got a sequel to the well acclaimed [**IT'S INNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!** moment!](https://imgur.com/7l2BEUW)

Thankfully (or sadly?) it actually wasn't in.

[*Silly Shino, you so clumsy!*](https://imgur.com/8fHAriW)

If they ever do something like that on purpose, Shino could use *clumsiness* as an excuse! After all, [she's quite aware of how dumb Saki is!](https://imgur.com/okMPA5s)

[She started cooking for them/watching their nutrition?](https://imgur.com/j9oyZrr)

It's over now, she's sticking with them for good!

[Technically, if they start 3-timing, she did put an end to the 2-timing... Right?](https://imgur.com/XGBOMjZ)

Festival next episode already? I didn't expect it so soon, but looking forward to it! [Seems Rika's gonna make some moves too, seducing him with her yukata!](https://imgur.com/MBMHsD8)

But I'm more intrigued about whether *Shino* will make some moves, intentionally or not! Come on Shino, we all know it's gonna happen, might as well get it out of the way real quick so you can enjoy your time with him!

Anyway, this was a fun one! I have to admit I was a bit unsure about how I'd feel about Shino, because she did not seem like 'my type' of anime girls, and also because everyone seemed to like her and somehow I often tend not to like the girls everyone else love... But so far I really like her! She's a good addition to the dynamic, and she has a lot of funny (and sometimes lewd) moments!

Shhhhhh

Though actually if the series is to not skip any chapters, they'd need to have 4 episodes covering 5 chapters and 8 episodes covering 4 chapters 

Ep 1 already covered 5 and ep 2 covered 4

Next 2 episodes can also cover 4 chapters each 

After that I'm uncertain but I pray we don't lose the [manga chapter and potential future episode scene spoiler] >!bra chapter!<",2
